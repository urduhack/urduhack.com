It is a modification of the Persian alphabet known as Perso-Arabic, which is itself a derivative of the Arabic alphabet.

    "# What is Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Character encoding may be defined as assigning a unique number to each language character to be processed by the computer. Whenever a character is input from keyboard or other input devices, this particular code is generated internally in the computer. Arbitrary encoding may be defined for any application (e.g. 80 for letter ‘a’, 81 for letter ‘b’). However, if different vendors are defining arbitrary encodings, their encodings may not agree with one another.\n",
    "With the advent of the Internet, it has now become increasingly essential to standardize the encoding scheme because users are accessing data created by a variety of sources through web browsers (a single application). Realizing the significance of standardizing encoding, work was done early for English and American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was defined in 1968. This standard had 128 slots defined using 7 bits by American National Standards Institute (ANSI)."

    "# What is Unicode\n",
    "Initially most documentation was done in a single language, therefore 8-bit single language code pages served the need. However, in 1990s, with increasing needs for multi-lingual documents (where one could require Japanese and Arabic in the same document), it was realized that defining 8-bit code pages were not a scalable solution. Adding code pages for various languages and scripts and using them together in one application created a lot of difficulty and complexity in processing because users had to keep toggling between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, major vendors got together and created Unicode consortium (www.unicode.org). This consortium started working on developing a singular, unified and universal code chart which would contain all characters of all languages. As 8-bit (256 slots) code pages were insufficient for this requirement, Unicode character encoding standard was developed using 16 bits (65536 slots). This space has been divided to cater to various scripts and thus bypassed the need for toggling for different languages."

The Urdu is incorporated in Arabic language's block in the Unicode table as Urdu is derived from Arabic script. This makes things a little bit complicated for computer scientists trying to develop applications for Urdu language.\n",

    "Now the problem is how do we know on which codes we have to train our model on? If we train our model on a specific range (Urdu 0600-06ff) and our dataset has some words formed using the Arabic set of codes then our application will fail to recognize those words resulting in low accuracy. This redundancy in codes of words hinders us to achieve a high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we handle this issue? You can go up and look at the Urdu Unicode Range table. Unicode has standardized this range (0600-06ff) for Urdu only. So all we need to do is to do some data pre-processing before running any alogrithm on data. For each word in data having redundant codes, we can replace that word with the same standardized Urdu word belonging to the range 0600 to 06ff. That's it!\n"
